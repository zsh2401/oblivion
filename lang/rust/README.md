# Introduce
All source codes under this direcotry is created for learning the programing language which named Rust.
I heard this language for a long time. There're many news told me that Rust if more memory-safe than C/C++, while its speed fater than those language run with costs of GC and runtime. 
I have also heard that Microsoft is restructing some Windows apps with Rust.
